# tflow2

tflow2 is an in memory netflow version 9 and IPFIX analyzer.
It is designed for fast arbitrary queries.

*This software is currently not maintained in this repo. Check out
https://github.com/taktv6/tflow2*

## Usage

Quick install with `go get -u github.com/google/tflow2`
and `go build github.com/google/tflow2`
or download a pre-built binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/google/tflow2/releases).

The release binaries have an additional command, `tflow2 -version`,
which reports the release version.

Once you start the main binary it will start reading netflow version 9 packets
on port `2055` UDP and IPFIX packets on port `4739` on all interfaces.
For user interaction it starts a webserver on port `4444` TCP on all interfaces. 

The webinterface allows you to run queries against the collected data.
Start time and router are mandatory criteria. If you don't provide any of
these you will always receive an empty result.

### Command line arguments
```
-aggregation=int 
```
  This is the time window in seconds used for aggregation of flows
```
-alsologtostderr
```
  Will send logs to stderr on top
```
-anonymize=bool
```
  If set to true IP addresses will be replaced with NULL before dumping
  flows to disk. Default is false.
```
-bgp=bool
```
  tflow will connect to BIRD and BIRD6 unix domain sockets to augment flows
  with prefix and autonomous system information. This is useful in case your
  routers exported netflow data is lacking these. This is the case for example
  if you use the ipt-NETFLOW on Linux.

  BIRD needs a BGP session to each router that is emitting flow packets.
  The protocol needs to be named like this: "nf_x_y_z_a" with x_y_z_a being the
  source IP address of flow packets, e.g. nf_185_66_194_0
```
-birdSock=path
```
  This is the path to the unix domain socket to talk to BIRD
```
-birdSock6=path
```
  This is the path to the unix domain socket to talk to BIRD6
```
-channelBuffer=int
```
  This is the amount of elements that any channel within the program can buffer.
```
-dbaddworkers=int
```
  This is the amount of workers that are used to add flows into the in memory
  database.
```
-debug=int
```
  Debug level. 1 will give you some more information. 2 is not in use at
  the moment. 3 will dump every single received netflow packet on the screen.
```
-log_backtrace_at
````
  when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace (default :0)
```
-log_dir
```
  If non-empty, write log files in this directory
```
-logtostderr
```
  log to standard error instead of files
```
-maxage=int
```
  Maximum age of flow data to keep in memory. Choose this parameter wisely or you
  will run out of memory. Experience shows that 500k flows need about 50G of RAM.
```
-netflow=addr
```
  Address to use to receive netflow packets (default ":2055") via UDP
```
-ipfix=addr
```
  Address to use to receive IPFIX packets (default ":4739") via UDP
```
--protonums=path
```
  CSV file to read protocol definitions from (default "protocol_numbers.csv").
  This is needed for suggestions in the web interface.
```
-samplerate=int
```
  Samplerate of your routers. This is used to deviate real packet and volume rates
  in case you use sampling.
```
-sockreaders=int
```
  Num of go routines reading and parsing netflow packets (default 24)
```
-stderrthreshold
```
  logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
```
-v value
```
  log level for V logs
```
-vmodule value
```
  comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
```
-web=addr
```
  Address to use for web service (default `:4444`)

## Limitations

This software currently only supports receiving netflow packets over IPv4.
Please be aware this software is not platform independent. It will only work
on little endian machines (such as x86)
